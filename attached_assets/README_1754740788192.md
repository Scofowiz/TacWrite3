## Security Features
- AES-256 encryption
- SHA-256 checksums for file integrity
- Blockchain timestamp verification
- Secure encryption/decryption scripts

## Using This Backup

### To Encrypt the Backup
1. Navigate to the build/scripts directory
2. Run the encryption script:
   ```bash
   ./encrypt_backup.sh <your-secure-password>
   ```
3. This will create an encrypted file: TACWrite-Backup-20250803.enc
4. Store your password securely - you'll need it for decryption

### To Decrypt the Backup
1. Navigate to the build/scripts directory
2. Run the decryption script:
   ```bash
  -encry ./decrypt_backup.sh <your-password> <path-topted-file> <output-directory>
   ```
3. Follow the recovery instructions in docs/recovery/RECOVERY.md

## Important Notes
- Keep this backup and its password secure
- Store multiple copies in different locations
- Test the backup regularly by performing a test recovery
- Verify file integrity using the provided checksums

## File Integrity
- All files have SHA-256 checksums in metadata/checksums/
- Always verify checksums after decryption
- Use the provided scripts which include automatic verification

## Recovery Process
See the detailed recovery instructions in docs/recovery/RECOVERY.md for:
- Complete restoration steps
- Dependencies installation
- Configuration setup
- Build and verification process

## Support Files
- manifest.json: Complete listing of backup contents
- RECOVERY.md: Detailed recovery instructions
- Checksums: File integrity verification
- Blockchain proof: Timestamp verification

## Security Recommendations
1. Store the encrypted backup file securely
2. Keep the password separate from the backup
3. Use different storage locations for redundancy
4. Regularly verify backup integrity
5. Test recovery process periodically

Remember: The security of this backup depends on keeping the encryption password safe and secure. Store it using a reliable password manager or secure system.
